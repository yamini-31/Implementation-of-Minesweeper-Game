We play on a square board and we have to click on the board on the cells which do not have a mine. And obviously we don’t know where mines are. If a cell where a mine is present is clicked then we lose, else we are still in the game. There are three levels for this game- Beginner – 9 * 9 Board and 10 Mines Intermediate – 16 * 16 Board and 40 Mines Advanced – 24 * 24 Board and 99 Mines

Hints for Winning the Game:

When we click on a cell having adjacent mines in one or more of the surrounding eight cells, then we get to know how many adjacent cells have mines in them. So we can do some logical guesses to figure out which cells have mines. If you click on a cell having no adjacent mines (in any of the surrounding eight cells) then all the adjacent cells are automatically cleared, thus saving our time. So we can see that we don’t always have to click on all the cells not having the mines (total number of cells – number of mines) to win. If we are lucky then we can win in very short time by clicking on the cells which don’t have any adjacent cells having mines.

Implementation:

Two implementations of the game are given here:

In the first implementation, the user’s move is selected randomly using rand() function. In the second implementation, the user himself select his moves using scanf() function.# Implementation-of-Minesweeper-Game
