## Overview

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game where the player's objective is to uncover all the cells on the board that do not contain mines. The game consists of a grid of cells, some of which contain hidden mines. The player can uncover cells one at a time and must use logic to avoid detonating any mines. If a mine is uncovered, the game is lost. The player wins by uncovering all non-mine cells on the board.

## How to Play
Choose a difficulty level (Child, Teenager, or Adult) when prompted.
The game board will be displayed with hidden cells represented by '-'. Your goal is to uncover all non-mine cells.
Enter your moves by specifying row and column numbers.
The game will reveal the content of the selected cell.
If you uncover a mine, the game is over.
If you uncover all non-mine cells, you win the game!

## Difficulty Levels
Child: 9x9 grid with 10 mines.
Teenager: 16x16 grid with 40 mines.
Adult: 24x24 grid with 99 mines.
